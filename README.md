# BMI-CALCULATOR
It is a very simple Web App to calculate the BMI, built using [express.js+node.js]

The dependencies on other node modules are as follows:
"dependencies": {
    "body-parser": "^1.19.0",
    "express": "^4.17.1"
  }

This is the app I built while first learning about node.js and express.js
Thanks.
